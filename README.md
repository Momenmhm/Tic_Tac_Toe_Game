# Tic_Tac_Toe game

![Demo](Images/X_O_Review.gif)

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using C# and Windows Forms.  
It allows two players to play against each other on the same computer.  
The game checks for a winner, detects draws, and shows clear messages for each result.


The interface is clean and easy to use, with buttons that update automatically when a player chooses a cell.  
The project also includes a reset option to start a new round without restarting the program.


This game is a small demonstration of basic OOP concepts, event handling, and UI design in Windows Forms.
